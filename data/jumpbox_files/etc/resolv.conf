# Placeholder resolv.conf
# Since the default namespace's /etc/resolv.conf never gets set by anything (there's no DHCP) and because
# we do actually route out the openvpn from the default namespace, we need to have some nameserver here.  
# I am putting 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8 as placeholders but also could use the default VPC DNS addy if wanted.

nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
