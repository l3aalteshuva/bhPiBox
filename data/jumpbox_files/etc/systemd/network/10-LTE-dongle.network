# systemd-networkd config to enable usb0
#
# This file takes the usb0 interface generated by udev and allows 
# systemd-networkd to handle setup and management of usb0, including DHCP and routing 
# By default, all our other interfaces need to be manually managed to maintain stealth
# on the customer network, but of course the LTE dongle is not on the customer net.
