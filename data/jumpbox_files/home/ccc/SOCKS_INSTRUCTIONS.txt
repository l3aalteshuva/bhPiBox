There should be a socks proxy running already inside of the customer namespace.  Verify by running:
    ip netns exec customer netstat -nap | grep 2222

if you don't see anything there, you maybe want to figure out why it's not running with:
    systemctl start socksproxy

If everything is operating as expected, you can utilize the socks proxy by way of this command:

    ssh -L 2222:169.254.2.2:2222 ccc@[OPENVPN_IP_FOR_JUMPBOX] && ssh -D 8080 ccc@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

That command will create a ssh local port forward on your host on port 2222 to the ssh server running on the customer namespace (169.254.2.2:2222), and then will create an SSH dynamic port forward service on your local machine on port 8080 by connecting to the customer namespace's locally-forwarded port on localhost:2222.


TL;DR:

    ssh -L 2222:169.254.2.2:2222 ccc@[OPENVPN_IP_FOR_JUMPBOX] && ssh -D 8080 ccc@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

then point whatever you want to hit the customer network at localhost:8080 with proxychains or similar.
